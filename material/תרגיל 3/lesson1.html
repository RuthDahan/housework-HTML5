        <p>About HTML5</p>
        <br>
        hi!,To understand how HTML has evolved over the years,<br>
        let’s look at the differences between HTML and HTML5.<br>
        HTML vs HTML5
        HTML is the World Wide Web's core markup language.<br>
         Originally designed to semantically describe scientific documents,<br>
         it has since evolved to describe much more.<br>
        Most pages on the web today were built using HTML4.<br>
        Although much improved since the first version of HTML written in 1993,<br>
         HTML4 still had its limitations.<br>
        It’s biggest was if web developers or designers wanted to add content <br>
        or features to their site that weren’t supported in HTML. In that case,<br>
        they would have to use non-standard proprietary technologies, like Adobe Flash,<br>
         which required users to install browser plugins.<br>
        Even then, some users wouldn’t be able to access that content or feature.<br>
         Users on iPhones and iPads,<br>
        for example, wouldn’t be able to since those devices don't support Flash.
        Cue, HTML5.<br>
         HTML5 was designed to cut out the need for those non-standard proprietary technologies. <br>
